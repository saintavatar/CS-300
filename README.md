# CS-300

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The projects consisted of developing a pseudocode and application designed to list classes for students along with any prerequisites associated with the class listed.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I started by reviewing the previous work including the flowcharts and pseudocode. I then set up the code to load CSV file to read the data, utilizing a menu for options that would print out courses and their prerequisites. The data structure selected ensures that there is Efficiency, Organization and Scalability, which make for clarity in the code and influences both the performance and maintainability of the data.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
As I worked through the project, I looked back at my previous work for reference. I also found w3schools.comto be a helpful resource when writing code, as it covers several different coding languages. Additionally, performing web searches often helped me correct errors that I missed.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
Working through the assignments and the project enhanced my understanding of the requirements, the selection of appropriate data structures, memory handling, and user interface design for simplicity and ease of access.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I now focus on modular design to allow for flexibility as needs change. Considering scalability is essential when coding, as most lists and databases expand over time and rarely reduce. I also emphasize clear documentation to guide the coding process and improve code readability, making it easier to locate and address issues.
